My area of expertise is in developing advanced mathematical and quantitative models for financial risk management, pricing, and decision-making. I specialize in creating sophisticated pricing models for complex financial products and designing risk measurement tools that assess key financial risks, such as interest rate and inflation risks. In addition, I use global sensitivity analysis and Shapley values to provide deeper insights into how different factors impact model outputs, making complex models more interpretable and reliable. My work has been applied to a wide range of fields, including finance, healthcare, and energy systems, where I have used these methods to better understand economic models, predict disease spread, and improve power grid reliability. By combining mathematical modeling with cutting-edge analytical techniques, I help develop robust models that support both industry decision-making and regulatory compliance, ultimately contributing to the stability and efficiency of the U.S. financial markets and other critical sectors.
