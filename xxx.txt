As a front-office quant, I led the development and integration of the repo curve model for the Vasara platform to support the repo desk. The project began with close collaboration with our line-of-business quants to construct a robust curve-building methodology tailored for repo markets. After developing the model, I conducted testing to validate its accuracy and stability.

To operationalize the model, I worked with the data sourcing team to ensure that the repo curves were properly sourced into Vasara. I then collaborated with Vasara quants, who function as engineers, to map these curves into Vasara, ensuring that the correct pricing models for repo transactions accessed the appropriate curves.

Throughout this process, I was responsible for validating each step, ensuring that the repo curve remained consistent across teams and aligned with expectations. This cross-team validation was crucial in maintaining the accuracy and usability of the curve across trading, risk, and analytics functions.

Following successful integration, I prepared front-office testing and documentation to support model validation, similar to my previous work. This included:

Curve Construction Soundness Testing – Verifying that the repo curve behaved correctly across different market conditions.
Cross-Team Consistency Checks – Ensuring that the curve matched expectations when used in different models across Vasara.
Sensitivity and Stress Testing – Measuring how the model performed under stressed funding market conditions.
To finalize adoption, I worked closely with model validators to gain internal approval for traders and other teams to officially use the model.

Findings & Impact
Enhanced Pricing Accuracy: The new repo curve model improved pricing precision for repo transactions, reducing errors due to curve mismatches.
Seamless Integration Across Vasara: Ensured that the correct repo pricer could reliably read the mapped curves, improving usability for trading desks.
Improved Model Governance: Rigorous cross-validation across teams led to a more transparent and auditable curve-building process.
This work significantly improved repo market risk assessment and trade pricing, ensuring that traders had access to consistent and accurate repo curves within Vasara.
