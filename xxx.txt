Industry Problem/Shortcoming:

In industries like finance, healthcare, and energy, models are used to make critical decisions. However:
Lack of Interpretability: Many complex models act like "black boxes," making it difficult to understand how inputs impact outputs.
Computational Challenges: Calculating global sensitivity indices and Shapley values for high-dimensional models is computationally expensive, limiting their practical use in real-world scenarios.
Suboptimal Decision-Making: Without understanding key drivers, decision-makers often focus on less important variables, leading to inefficiencies.
How Your Project Solves It:

You developed efficient computational methods to estimate global sensitivity indices and Shapley values, making these analyses feasible for large, high-dimensional models.
By improving interpretability, your work helps stakeholders identify the most critical inputs driving a model's output, leading to better-informed decisions.
In finance: Helps identify the factors most impacting risk or returns in portfolios.
In healthcare: Guides attention to the most critical biomarkers or treatment variables.
In energy: Highlights the most influential factors affecting power grid stability or renewable energy optimization.
Your methods reduce resource consumption (time, computational power), making sensitivity analysis accessible to organizations with limited infrastructure.
